# What is this ?
Welcome travellers.


This is my personal repo for review javascript before learning React and other frameworks 
as well as preparing for an interview.
The resources are structured into topics, however for some topics that worth noting will have its separate folder. In some folders, you will find answers and solutions for those to practice. Finally, all of these will be stored in folder `src`.

One thing worth noticing that this personal repo is not for beginners but instead for someone who already have some experiences with other programming languages  and want to learn with me about JavaScript and its weirdness.

```
{} + [] + {} + [1]
```

The above expression return `0[object Object]1`, you will know why if you dig in MDN document or read my notes (everything is extracted from MDN anyway).

Take time and learn with me, if there is any errors or misunderstanding, I will be happy to fix them as soon as possible.

Algorithms implemented in JavaScript will also available at `algorithms`, and they will have its own folder.

# What book was used as references for data structures and algorithms ?
People often recommend the CLRS or Introduction to Algorithm, but in my opinion, this book is too academic for beginners and who are sometimes get scare looking at thick books with more than 1000 pages (yep, it's me). After searching for many good books, I stop at this book on Amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Algorithms-Rod-Stephens/dp/1118612108

If you know any book that easy to read, well-structured, please let me know.
# Resouces
Please note that, I will use Frontend Master website to learn most of the concept in Javascript.
However, I will also give the additional free links.
